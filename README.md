# Enterprise Architecture Blueprint

## **Project Overview**
This project serves as a comprehensive **guide for planning and designing Enterprise Architecture (EA)** by connecting **business strategy with IT implementation**. It provides a structured approach covering **Business Capability Mapping, Service Domain Models, Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, and **technical design aspects like Business Object Models and Service API design**.

## **Project Goals**
- Define a **methodology for Enterprise Architecture Planning**.
- Establish a **business-to-IT alignment framework**.
- Provide **concrete examples** of Business Capability Models, Service Domains, and APIs.
- Enable **modular, scalable, and domain-driven IT design**.

## **Project Structure & Key Deliverables**

### **1. Business Architecture**
ðŸ“Œ **Goal**: Define business capabilities and value streams that drive enterprise strategy.

- **Business Capability Mapping**
  - Identifying key business capabilities.
  - Structuring hierarchical capability models.
  - Mapping capabilities to business processes.
- **Value Streams & Business Processes**
  - Understanding customer and internal value streams.
  - Process mapping techniques.
- **Business Object Model (BOM)**
  - Defining core business entities and relationships.
  - Transitioning from conceptual to logical models.

### **2. Service Domain Modeling**
ðŸ“Œ **Goal**: Define Service Domains that align with business capabilities and support modular IT architecture.

- **Service Domain Models**
  - Identifying domains and defining boundaries.
  - Mapping domains to Business Capabilities.
- **Service-Oriented Business Components**
  - Designing reusable, independent services.
  - Organizing services into logical groups.
- **Domain Events & Integration Strategies**
  - Event-driven architectures and service interactions.
  - API contracts and message-driven systems.

### **3. Domain-Driven Design (DDD) in Enterprise Architecture**
ðŸ“Œ **Goal**: Apply **DDD principles** to structure the IT architecture around business domains.

- **Bounded Contexts & Aggregates**
  - Defining domain boundaries and entities.
  - Aggregates, repositories, and transactional consistency.
- **Event Storming & Business Logic Mapping**
  - Mapping domain events to real-world business operations.
  - Capturing workflows and transitions.
- **Strategic DDD Patterns**
  - Aligning Core, Supporting, and Generic domains.
  - Using Anti-Corruption Layers to manage system integration.

### **4. API & System Design**
ðŸ“Œ **Goal**: Provide practical guidelines for designing APIs and implementing service contracts.

- **Service API Design**
  - REST vs. GraphQL vs. gRPC.
  - API versioning and lifecycle management.
- **Business Capability-Driven API Design**
  - Exposing capabilities as well-defined APIs.
  - Ensuring API consistency with domain models.
- **Security & Compliance**
  - Implementing API security best practices.
  - Data privacy, encryption, and regulatory compliance.

### **5. Case Studies & Examples**
ðŸ“Œ **Goal**: Demonstrate real-world implementations of Enterprise Architecture principles.

- **Example: Banking Sector**
  - Business Capability Map for Retail Banking.
  - Loan & Collateral Service Domain Models.
  - API definitions for credit scoring and risk management.
- **Example: E-Commerce Platform**
  - Business Capability Map for Order Management.
  - Microservices architecture using DDD principles.
  - API contracts for product, inventory, and order services.
